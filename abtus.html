                <br>
                <p>Namdang, the house of the Spartans, has impacted itself in the history of The Assam Valley School as a house that is driven by character and integrity.<br> Known for producing a few of the finest individuals the school has ever seen, Namdang is truly a proud house built on principles and ideologies stemming from the house motto “Dare to Excel”.<br> The boys of Namdang are taught to dare, placing the search for excellence over accomplishment as the house aims to create gentlemen out of boys. The House boasts of several Intra-house events designed to stimulate overall holistic development of the child, while also teaching them important life skills such as ethics, sportsmanship and strong determination.<br> True to their name, the Spartans, Namdang believes deeply in the ideas of brotherhood and fraternity- each Spartan looking after his fellow comrade in all spheres of school life.<br>

                    “We stand shoulder to shoulder, shield to shield, united and unwavering”.</p>
